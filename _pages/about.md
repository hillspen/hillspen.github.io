Hi there! I'm Spencer Hill, a master's student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Queen's University. I work on machine learning and information theory under the supervision of [Fady Alajaji](https://mast.queensu.ca/~fady/) and [Tam√°s Linder](https://mast.queensu.ca/~linder/). I hold a BASc (Engineering) degree from Queen's University, where I studied [Apple Math (Mathematics and Engineering)](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/undergraduate/prospective-undergraduate/mthe) with an option in computing and communications (read: I was a mathematician with a coding side hustle). 

I am broadly interested in problems that sit at the intersection of machine learning/artificial intelligence and mathematics. I am especially interested in investigating the theoretical limits of machine learning algorithms and designing ones which have provable guarantees (and can actually be implemented on a computer!). This has previously manifested as work on [faster Guassian processes for computational chemistry](/publications/), [GAN's](/projects/), [Quantum Machine Learning](/projects/), [neural image compression](/projects/), and reinforcement learning.

Recently, my master's research has focused on the theory of channel simulation, which is the problem of communicating a random sample from a distribution at low cost. This idea has recently been applied to [neural-network-based compression](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/ba053350fe56ed93e64b3e769062b680-Abstract.html) to make the system end-to-end differentiable and able to be trained using gradient descent. My research has (so far) generalized the theoretical limits of channel simulation to an [exponential cost](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.12219). 

I am also currently collaborating with researchers from the [Queen's University Smith School of Business](https://www.juewang.ca/) and [Natural Resources Canada](https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/employees/read/dyemshan) to design reinforcement learning algorithms to optimally track the spread of invasive species.
