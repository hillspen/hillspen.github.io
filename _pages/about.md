Hi there! I'm Spencer Hill, I am a master's student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Queen's University. I work on machine learning and information theory under the supervision of [Fady Alajaji](https://mast.queensu.ca/~fady/) and [Tam√°s Linder](https://mast.queensu.ca/~linder/). I hold a BASc (Engineering) degree from Queen's University, where I completed the ["Apple Math" (Mathematics and Engineering)](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/undergraduate/prospective-undergraduate/mthe) program with an option in computing and communications (read: I was a mathematician with a coding side hustle). 

I am broadly interested in problems that sit at the intersection of machine learning/artificial intelligence and mathematics. I am especially interested in investigating the theoretical limits of machine learning algorithms and designing ones which have provable guarantees. This has previously manifested as work on [faster Guassian processes for computational chemistry](/publications/), [GAN's](/projects/), [Quantum Machine Learning](/projects/), [neural image compression](/projects/), and reinforcement learning.

Recently, my master's research has focused on the theory of channel simulation, which is the problem of communicating a random sample from a distribution at low cost. This idea has recently been applied to [neural-network-based compression](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/ba053350fe56ed93e64b3e769062b680-Abstract.html) to make the system end-to-end differentiable and able to be trained using gradient descent. My research has (so far) generalized the theoretical limits of channel simulation to an [exponential cost](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.12219). I am also currently collaborating with researchers from the [Queen's University Smith School of Business](https://www.juewang.ca/) and [Natural Resources Canada](https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/employees/read/dyemshan) to design reinforcement learning algorithms to optimally track the spread of invasive species. 

I expect to graduate from my master's in May 2026 and will be applying to PhD programs to start Fall 2026. Send me an [email](spencer.hill@queensu.ca) if you know 


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
